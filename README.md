What is Chickensoup?
====================

Chickensoup was orginally a simple HTTP server which focused on minimizing bandwitdh
and operate efficiently on embedded systems (such as the old Raspbbery Pi 1).
However, as my requirements grew, it became more and more complex, especially while I
tried to keep it is as efficient as possible (which failed horribly).

At some point, I decided to abandon the project in favor of a complete redesign, which
will focus on splitting functionality into separate programs to allow the use of
multiple embedded devices and even allow the use of multiple languages without much
(if any) added complexity. I decided to keep the project as a testimony to my failure.

If you wish to use any of the code (or even all of it), feel free to do so. Just give
me credit by linking this repository.

PS: I may have broken the build with the last few commits (I honestly can't remember)
    but previous versions should still work. I'll try to figure out which ones still
    work and tag them when I have spare time I don't know how to use elsewhere.

PS2: You will need [my libraries](https://github.com/Demindiro/cs-Libraries) if you
     want to build this project.
